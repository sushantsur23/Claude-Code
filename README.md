# 🚀 Project Objective

This project demonstrates how to deploy a professional static website to Amazon S3 and CloudFront using an agent-driven DevOps workflow — without manually writing Terraform files, CI/CD pipelines, or YAML configurations.

Instead of spending the majority of engineering time authoring infrastructure code, this approach shifts the focus back to what truly matters: architectural decisions, security validation, cost optimization, and production readiness.

## 🎯 Core Objective

To build a fully functional, production-grade cloud deployment pipeline where:

AI agents generate Terraform, CI/CD workflows, IAM policies, and infrastructure configurations.

Engineers operate as reviewers, decision-makers, and controllers — not repetitive code authors.

Safety guardrails prevent destructive actions before execution.

Context, memory, and external integrations ensure reliable and scalable automation.

## 🧠 Key Principles

Skills: Modular, reusable capabilities that scaffold infrastructure (e.g., Terraform, CI/CD, deployment workflows).

Agents: Specialized AI assistants with defined responsibilities (e.g., Security Auditor, Cost Optimizer, Drift Detector, Terraform Writer).

Hooks & Guardrails: Protective controls to prevent misconfigurations and destructive actions.

Memory & MCP Integration: Persistent context and external tool connectivity for continuous, state-aware automation.

## 🏗 Outcome

By the end of this project, you will:

Deploy a production-ready website on AWS S3 + CloudFront.

Implement an AI-orchestrated DevOps workflow.

Establish secure, review-first infrastructure automation.

Transition from “infrastructure coder” to “infrastructure architect.”
